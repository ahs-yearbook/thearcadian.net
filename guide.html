# Why Join?
Advanced Journalism is the only class on campus 
that offers students the opportunity to work in 
a professional publishing environment where 
students are exposed to the fundamentals of 
journalism, business, and art as they embark on 
the yearlong journey to create The Arcadian, AHS
' yearbook. Every student has the opportunity to 
interview, research, make connections, learn how 
to write professional copy, take photos, and 
express themselves through graphic design. We 
tell stories about real people and real life, 
and we use these stories to document the beauty, 
wonder, and struggle that every student 
experiences in a year at AHS.

## What do we do?
We are students, writers, designers, 
photographers, and artists who employ our skills 
to capture the moments that define the year.

## What do we represent?
We represent every student on campus, and we 
work to capture their stories and preserve their 
memories.

## Our Course
Students on the Arcadian yearbook staff will be 
required to learn layout design, writing and 
editing, photo cropping and placement, and 
computer graphics with use of Adobe InDesign CS 
and Photoshop programs. Students seeking staff 
positions must have strong organizational skills
, work well under pressure, and understand the 
importance of deadlines. Student editorial staff 
members plan and execute the entire publication 
process. Members gain experience with budgeting, 
planning, and learning journalistic skills.
