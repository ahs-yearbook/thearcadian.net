# 2020-2021 Yearbook Staff

## Eics & Managing

The editor-in-chiefs and managing editors head 
the entire yearbook process. They are in charge 
of making sure everything goes smoothly and put 
the final seal of approval before sending the 
proofs in to Balfour. As the leaders of this 
student-led publication, they oversee the
editors, who in turn, watch over their respective
sections. Deadlines, quality work, and creativity
are all elements of The Arcadian that the EICs
and managing editors are responsible for.

Editor-in-Chiefs: Sarah Delima and Hannah Shin

Managing Editors: Danielle Wong and Michelle Tan

## Academics

Apaches hit the books hard, and it’s Academics 
section’s job to cover the plethora of classes 
and academic teams that keep our students busy. 
Other than the core curriculum classes, 
Academics covers nationally ranked teams, such 
as Constitution Team and Ocean Sciences Bowl. 
They also are responsible for seeking out 
everyday students taking a variety of classes to 
obtain an up-close-and-personal aspect to the 
AHS classroom.

Editor: Carolyn Chen

Staff: Amy Dong, Elizabeth Skehan, and Justin Wang
