## Senior Superlatives

Who is the funniest person you know? Who is a good shoulder to cry on? Who do YOU think will RULE THE WORLD? 

To share your opinion and help us pick a winner for all of our superlative categories, be sure to fill out the “Senior Superlative” google form emailed to your student email. These will be due October 25th, so get to it ASAP!

## Request to be included in this year’s yearbook

If you would like to be interviewed for the yearbook, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/a6iC4VS4NmuurPYW9)

Because we anticipate that a lot of people will be filling this form out, we want to mention that this does not guarantee you a yearbook interview. However, due to the limited space we have in the yearbook, we may not be able to interview you all. 

That being said, filling out this form is still strongly encouraged :)
