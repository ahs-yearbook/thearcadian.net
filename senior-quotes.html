# Senior Ads

Hello Seniors and Senior parents!

It's that time of yearâ€”time to purchase a senior
tribute!

We offer the parents of seniors priority to take
advantage of this opportunity to celebrate the
graduation of your child. By purchasing an ad,
you can commemorate your child for completing
this chapter of their life with personalized
messages and photos.

The pages dedicated to seniors would include
various options such as (models in slideshow at
bottom of page)

1/8 of a page: $75

1/4 of a page: $130

1/2 of a page: $220

1 full page: $400


These are the early purchase prices which will
increase after November 1st.

Please keep in mind that there is a limited
number of pages for ads. Last year, senior
tributes sold out before the first price increase,
so don't delay! 

If you would like to purchase a senior ad for
